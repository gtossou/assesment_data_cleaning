What the script do :
	
	-Read X_train.txt, y_train.txt and subject_train.txt 
	-Read X_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt 
	-Merges testData to trainData in joinData;
	-Merges testLabel to trainLabel in joinLabel;
	-Merges testSubject to trainSubject in joinSubject.
	-Read the features.txt file and store the data in a variable called features.
	-Extracton of mean and standard deviation.This results in a 66 indices list.
	-Clean the column names of the subset. We remove the "()" and "-" symbols in the names
	-Read the activity_labels.txt file 
	-Clean the activity names in the second column of activity. Names in lower cases and remove the underscores
	-Merges  joinSubject, joinLabel and joinData by column to get a new cleaned 10299x68 data frame, cleanedData. 
	-Write the cleanedData out to "merged_data.txt" file in current working directory.
	-Finally, generate a second independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.
